✅ What is a ViewModel?
	A ViewModel is a class that is designed to hold and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It survives configuration changes like screen rotations, ensuring data is not lost when the UI is recreated. 

✅ What is a LiveData?
	LiveData is an observable data holder class that is used as a communication bridge. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services. This awareness ensures LiveData only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.
