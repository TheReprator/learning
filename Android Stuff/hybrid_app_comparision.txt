📦 Deep Dive: Architecture, Analogy, Pros, and Cons
	🔵 React Native
		🔧 Architecture:
			• Uses JavaScript to control native components.
			• Communicates via a bridge (JS ↔ native layer).

		🎭 Analogy:
			Like a translator between two teams — one speaks English (JavaScript), the other speaks native languages. The bridge acts as a real-time interpreter.

		✅ Pros:
			• Fast development with hot reload
			• Huge ecosystem (JS libraries, NPM)
			• Code reuse between web (React) and mobile
			• Backed by Meta (Facebook)

		❌ Cons:
			• Performance bottlenecks due to the JS bridge
			• Native module dependency hell
			• Not pixel-perfect (depends on platform components)
			• Debugging and memory issues can arise

		🚀 Use Case:
			• A cross-platform e-commerce or social app with a JS-heavy web team.
			• Companies using React on the web (e.g., Facebook, Shopify, Discord)

		✅ Choose React Native if:
			• Your team is already strong in JavaScript or React.
			• Great for web teams transitioning to mobile.
			• You need fast prototyping and wide plugin support.
			• Thousands of NPM packages, UI kits, and community plugins.
			• You want to share business logic between Web + Mobile.
			• Example: A product team building a dashboard app for web and mobile.

		🚫 Avoid if:
			• You need high-performance graphics or animations.
			• You want to avoid runtime bridges and native dependency hell.


	🟣 Flutter
		🔧 Architecture:
			• Written in Dart, uses its own rendering engine (Skia).
			• Draws every pixel (custom widgets) — doesn't rely on native UI.

		🎭 Analogy:
			Like a theme park where you design everything from scratch (custom UI engine)

		✅ Pros:
			• Consistent UI across platforms
			• High performance (no native bridge)
			• Rich animation and graphics support
			• Great tooling and DevTools

		❌ Cons:
			• Large app size
			• Native look-and-feel needs manual effort
			• Dart is less popular than JavaScript/Kotlin
			• Limited access to some native features (without plugins)

		🚀 Use Case:
			• High-performance apps with rich animations (e.g., fintech, edtech, travel)
			• MVPs or startups targeting multiple platforms quickly
			• Examples: Google Pay, Alibaba, BMW, eBay Motors

		✅ Choose Flutter if:
			• You want consistent UI across platforms.
			• Flutter draws everything, so it looks identical everywhere.
			• You need beautiful UIs or animations.
			• Great for startups, fintech, travel apps, or anything needing polish.
			• You plan to launch on multiple platforms (mobile, web, desktop).
			• Flutter supports all of them fairly well.

		🚫 Avoid if:
			• App size is a concern (Flutter adds ~5–10 MB)
			• You prefer native widgets or native look-and-feel
			• Your team doesn’t want to learn Dart


	🟢 Jetpack Compose Multiplatform (JCM)
		🔧 Architecture:
			• Fully written in Kotlin, uses Compose’s declarative UI.
			• Uses native rendering on Android, experimental for iOS & desktop.

		🎭 Analogy:
			Like a multilingual native speaker — speaks fluently across Android, iOS, and Desktop with no interpreter needed.

		✅ Pros:
			• Native performance, no bridge
			• Shared UI and business logic in Kotlin
			• Fully Jetpack-compatible on Android
			• Great for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) projects

		❌ Cons:
			• Web & Desktop are still evolving
			• Smaller community and ecosystem
			• Less third-party support (compared to Flutter or RN)
			• Requires Kotlin experience

		🚀 Use Case:
			• Teams deeply invested in Kotlin
			• Gradual adoption from existing Android codebases
			• Example: Building an Android app now, with iOS support planned later

		✅ Choose Compose Multiplatform if:
			• You already have Android expertise in Kotlin.
			• Seamless learning curve from Compose for Android to Multiplatform.
			• You want native performance + platform-native UI feel.
			• Great for production apps where Android is the priority.
			• You're using Kotlin Multiplatform (KMM) for shared business logic.
			• Works best when UI and logic can both be shared in Kotlin.

		🚫 Avoid if:
			• You need stable Desktop/Web support today.
			• Your team isn’t familiar with Kotlin or Android concepts.
			• You’re building a highly polished iOS-first app.
