📊 1. Arrangement (Main Axis)
    • What it does: Controls how multiple children are distributed along the main axis of a layout
                    container like Row or Column.
    • Main Axis Direction:
            • Row → Horizontal (left-to-right)
            • Column → Vertical (top-to-bottom)
    • Used with:
            • Row: horizontalArrangement
            • Column: verticalArrangement
    • Important Constraint:
            • Row ❌ cannot use verticalArrangement
            • Column ❌ cannot use horizontalArrangement

    • 📍 Types of Arrangements
        Name	                    Description
        Arrangement.Start / Top	    Children are aligned to the start (left/top).
        Arrangement.End / Bottom	Children aligned to the end (right/bottom).
        Arrangement.Center	        Children are centered within the parent.
        Arrangement.SpaceBetween	First and last children stick to the edges, others spaced evenly.
        Arrangement.SpaceAround	    Equal space around all children (half-size at start/end).
        Arrangement.SpaceEvenly	    Equal space between all children including start and end.
        Arrangement.spacedBy(dp)	Fixed spacing between children only.

🧱 2. Alignment (Cross Axis)
    • What it does: Controls how a child is positioned within its parent’s bounds, especially when:
            • There is only one child
            • You want to override default alignment behavior
    • Cross Axis Direction:
            • Row → Vertical (top-to-bottom)
            • Column → Horizontal (left-to-right)
    • Used with:
            • Row: verticalAlignment
            • Column: horizontalAlignment
    • Important Constraint:
            • Row ❌ cannot use horizontalAlignment
            • Column ❌ cannot use verticalAlignment

    • contentAlignment
        ✅ Used in: Box
                • Aligns the content inside the Box (children as a whole)
                • Aligns both horizontally and vertically
                • Affects all children unless overridden with Modifier.align()

    • 🔄 Can be overridden per-child using Modifier.align()

🧩 Quick Recap Table
    Layout	    Main Axis	    Cross Axis	    Arrangement Used	            Alignment Used
    Row	        Horizontal	    Vertical	    horizontalArrangement ✅	    verticalAlignment ✅
    Column	    Vertical	    Horizontal	    verticalArrangement ✅	        horizontalAlignment ✅


🔁 Rule of Thumb
    • Use Arrangement to control main axis spacing.
    • Use Alignment to control cross axis alignment.
