🧱 Why Do We Need Surface in Jetpack Compose?
	At first glance, you might think:
		“Why use Surface when I can use Box, Row, or Column for layout?”
	But Surface isn’t just a layout container — it provides material-level visual styling and behavior. Here's how it differs:


	✅ 1. Surface = Material Design Container
	Surface is a semantic, Material Design-aware container. It's primarily used to:
		● Apply elevation
		● Respect shape
		● Handle tonal elevation and shadows
		● Apply background and border colors
		● Handle content color propagation (contentColor)

	So it's not just layout — it’s a visual styling + theme + material context component.


🔍 Key Features of Surface
	Feature						Surface								Box / Row / Column

	Background color			✅ Built-in (via color)								❌ Need Modifier.background
	Elevation (shadow)			✅ Native											❌ Not supported
	Shape (rounded corners)		✅ Built-in											❌ Needs clip() modifier
	Tonal elevation				✅ Supported										❌ No
	Border						✅ Optional											❌ Must be added manually
	Content color				✅ Propagated using CompositionLocalProvider		❌ No


✅ Example:
	Surface(
    	color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primaryContainer,
    	shape = RoundedCornerShape(12.dp),
    	shadowElevation = 4.dp
	) {
    	Text(
        	text = "Inside a Surface",
        	style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyLarge,
        	color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.onPrimaryContainer,
        	modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)
    	)
	}

	If you replaced this with a Box, you'd have to manually add:
		● Modifier.background(...)
		● Modifier.clip(...)
		● Modifier.shadow(...)
		Plus manually handle color propagation.


🎯 Use Cases for Surface
	Use Surface when:
			● You're building Material-compliant components
			● You want to control elevation and shape
			● You need a reusable themed surface (like cards, sheets, buttons)
			● You want automatic content color handling (e.g., text adapts to background)

🆚 When to Use Box, Row, or Column?
	Use these when:
			● You just need layout control
			● No elevation, shape, or color is involved
			● You’re inside a Surface already and don't want to nest unnecessarily


✅ Final Thought
		Think of Surface as the Material Design equivalent of a Card, Sheet, or Container — not just a layout, but a visual and semantic wrapper with theming, color, shape, and elevation support.
