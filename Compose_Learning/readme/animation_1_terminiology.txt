🧠 BASIC MEANING (Novice-Friendly)
	Imagine you have a photo on your desk. Now imagine doing the following:

		📏 1. Scale = Resize the photo
			You're either zooming in or zooming out.

				● scaleX = 2f → make it twice as wide
				● scaleY = 0.5f → make it half as tall

			Think: Stretch or shrink

		🔁 2. Translate = Move the photo around
			You slide the photo left, right, up, or down.

				● translationX = 50f → move right by 50 pixels
				● translationY = -30f → move up by 30 pixels

			Think: Shift the position

		🎥 3. Camera Distance = Depth into screen
			You push the photo farther or closer to your eyes (for 3D effects like rotation).

				● cameraDistance = 8f → controls the perspective effect in 3D when rotating.
				● Lower values make the object feel more "zoomed in" when rotated in 3D.

			Think: Depth / distance from viewer for 3D rotation effects



🧩 Quick Recap
	Transformation		What It Does									Example
	scaleX/Y			Stretch/shrink horizontally or vertically		scaleX = 2f → 2x wide
	translationX/Y		Move left/right or up/down						translationX = 100f → shift right
	cameraDistance		Simulates 3D depth for rotation					cameraDistance = 8f → closer view
