A very important feature of the Layout phase is the single pass measurement. This means that a layout element may not measure any of its children more than once. Single-pass measurement is good for performance, allowing Compose to efficiently handle deep UI trees.

when to use, drawCircle, drawArc, path(quadraticTo, cubicTo)




When to Use Which:
Use onGloballyPositioned when you need to know the global position in the window or screen coordinates, perhaps for creating overlays or implementing drag-and-drop features across different parts of the UI.
Use onPlaced when you're only interested in your Composable's position relative to its parent, and you want to avoid the overhead of monitoring the entire UI tree.
